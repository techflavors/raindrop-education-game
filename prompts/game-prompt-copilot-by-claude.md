# Raindrop Battle - Educational Game Development Prompt

## Project Overview
Create an engaging, colorful educational web game for K-8 students where learning becomes a competitive and fun experience through a raindrop collection battle system.

## Core Game Concept
- **Theme**: Students collect raindrops by answering questions correctly to fill their water cup
- **Competition**: Battle system where students can challenge peers with harder questions
- **Visual**: Vibrant, animated, kid-friendly interface with water/rain theme
- **Target**: Grades 1-8 with age-appropriate content

## Technical Stack Requirements

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js or NestJS
- **Database**: MongoDB (local, default port 27017)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with JWT authentication
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for live battles and leaderboards

### Frontend Options (Choose One)
1. **React + Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and component reusability
2. **Vue.js + GSAP**: For reactive UI with powerful animation library
3. **Next.js + Three.js**: For SSR benefits and 3D water effects
4. **Svelte + Canvas API**: For lightweight, performant animations

### Database Schema Design

```javascript
// Collections Structure
Users {
  _id, username, password, role: ['admin'|'teacher'|'student'],
  profile: { firstName, lastName, avatar, grade, createdAt }
}

Teachers {
  _id, userId, assignedGrade, subject, studentIds[], questionsCreated[]
}

Students {
  _id, userId, grade, teacherIds[], currentLevel, totalRaindrops,
  cupProgress: 0-100, achievements[], battleHistory[]
}

Questions {
  _id, teacherId, grade, subject, questionText, questionType,
  imageUrl?, difficulty: ['beginner'|'advanced'|'expert'],
  answers: [{ text, isCorrect, points }],
  basePoints: { beginner: 10, advanced: 25, expert: 50 }
}

Assignments {
  _id, teacherId, questionIds[], studentIds[], 
  dueDate, timeLimit, status, createdAt
}

GameSessions {
  _id, studentId, assignmentId, responses[], 
  raindropsEarned, timeSpent, completedAt
}

Battles {
  _id, challengerId, opponentId, questionIds[],
  winner, scores: {}, status, createdAt
}
```

## LLM Integration for Question Generation

```javascript
// AI Question Generation Template
const generateQuestionPrompt = {
  grade: "2nd",
  subject: "Math",
  topic: "Addition",
  count: 5,
  includeImages: true,
  difficulties: ["beginner", "advanced", "expert"],
  format: {
    question: "string",
    type: "multiple-choice|true-false|fill-blank",
    answers: [{ text: "", correct: boolean, points: number }],
    explanation: "string",
    hints: ["string"]
  }
};
```
